# Assignment 02

## Part I: code review of previous assignment

Using the solution and the technical note for the [previous assignment](https://github.com/edu-luc-cs-leo/comp271f24-01/tree/main/01-large-number-multiplication#part-ii-grade-school-multiplication), conduct a code review for your **multiplication program**. In your review:

* describe any red, yellow, or green level issues with your code. For red and yellow issues, discuss what led to them;
* suggest how the code could be improved;
* reflect if the quality of your code is related to time management and how to mitigate things.
* propose how Leo's code can be improved.

Your review must exude professionalism: few (ideally no) typos, and nicely organized. You may produce it as a PDF file to attach to Sakai, or as plain text typed straight in the Sakai textbox. It may be a good idea if you used an editor to compose your review, then past the text in Sakai to avoid loss of data.

## Part II: creating a data structure object

Using the Java class `DynamicArray` provided here, write the following two methods:

* `public boolean contains(String target)` that returns `true` if `target` is present in the underlying array and `false` if it isn't.
* `public String get(int index)` that returns the string in position `[index]` in the underlying array or null if something wrong.

**Two more methods added after class on 9/9/24.** These methods are also due on 9/13/24.

* `public String remove(int index)` that returns the value in position `[index]` in the underlying array then removes that value from the array.

* `public void delete(int index)` that removes the value from position `[index]` in the underlying array.

**Last two methods added after class on 9/11/24.** These methods are due on 9/13/24 as well.

* `public void insert(String string)` that adds a string in the `DynamicArray` object, overcoming the fixed size of the `foundation` array.

* `private void resize()` that increases the size of the `foundation` array as needed to accomodate additional strings inserted to the object.

Notice that the methods are *not static.*  

Except for the contents of these two methods, you cannot modify the code provided here. 

Your code must be in full compliance with the [Programmer's Pact](../misc/ProgrammerPact.pdf). You may not import any package except of `Arrays` and only to use ``Arrays.toString`` (not actually needed for this assignment). Also you may not use any `System` utilities except for `System.out` print statetements.

Once you have the specified methods working properly, the code will compile and execute a few tests as shown below. 

```
Test for contains(null): ............... Pass
Test for contains on null foundation: .. Pass
Test for contains (existing): .......... Pass
Test for contains (non existing): ...... Pass
Test for get(-1): ...................... Pass
Test for get(0): ....................... Pass
Test for get(out of bounds): ........... Pass

Test for remove(1): .................... Pass
Test for remove(null): ................. Pass
Test for remove(out of bounds): ........ Pass
```

There are two more lines in `DynamicArray.main`, to validate your `insert` and `resize` methods:
```java
// If all is good, these two statemets will not crash the program
test.insert("Pascal");
test.insert("Basic");
```

## Reading material

Our work for far is based on chapters 3, 4, 7, and 8 of the textbook used in COMP 170. The book is *not* required however for COMP 271. Instead, you may review the following material. And if you require additional reading resources, please let me know.

* [Classes and Objects tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/index.html) from the Java documentation project. Skip the material for nested classes and enum(eration)s for now.

* [Java in a Nutshell](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/java-in-a/9781098130992/), avaiable from the O'Reilly platform at no cost when you use your LUC email to login.
