# Technical note: $\mathcal O(n^2)$ and $\mathcal O(n\log_2n)$ sorting

In this assignment we evaluate the peformance of two sorting methods. One critical suggestion was that you do *not* do the testing in the `main` method but you write a separate method to be called from `main`.


# Assessment guidelines

## Red-level issues

* If your midterm grade was C+ or less, this assignment gave you an opportunity to shine, by writing a separate method instead of conducting the measurements in `main`. Did you avail yourselves to the opportunity? 
* Your test array size does not increment exponentially, as suggested in the assignment. 
* Your work does not include a plot of the results.
* Your work does not include a discussion of your findings.
* Program does not compile/execute.
* Program has minimal or no comments.
* Program has non descriptive variable names, such as single-letter names -- ok to use them for loop indices though.
* Any violation of the Programmer's Pact is a red issue.
* No Javadoc.
* **Code has magic values**. 
* Assignment is incomplete (one or more of the three required methods are missing; ungrading reflection is missing).

## Yellow level issues

* You use different arrays to test the two methods.
* You do not average a few tests for each array size.


## Green level issues

* Output is close to specified but not identical
