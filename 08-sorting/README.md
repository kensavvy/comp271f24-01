# Assignment 08

## Part I: code review of previous assignment

Using the [solution and technical note]() for the previous assignment, conduct a code review for your implementation of ``stringTo``, ``insert``, and ``isEmpty`` methods. In your review:

* describe any red, yellow, or green level issues with your code. For red and yellow issues, discuss what led to them;
* suggest how the code could be improved;
* reflect if the quality of your code is related to time management and how to mitigate things.
* propose how Leo's code can be improved.

Your review must exude professionalism: few (ideally no) typos, and nicely organized. You may produce it as a PDF file to attach to Sakai, or as plain text typed straight in the Sakai textbox. It may be a good idea if you used an editor to compose your review, then past the text in Sakai to avoid loss of data.
 

## Part II:  

Class `Sorting` implements two different sorting techniques: `insertionSort` and `mergeSort`. Both techniques were discussed in class.

Study the code to get a better understanding how the techniques work, especially the recursive tasks in merge-sort.

## Reading material
 
* [Sorting](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/art-of-computer/9780321635792/ch05.xhtml) from Donald Knuth's *Art of Computer Programming,* Volume 3: Sorting and Searching. This is the most definitive treatise on sorting. Merge sort is discussed in section 5.2.4. What makes Knuth's work a bit difficult in the beginning is that pseudocode is written in the **assembly** language of a fictitious machine called [MIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIX_(abstract_machine)). 

* [Sorting and searching algorithms](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/40-algorithms-every/9781789801217/7f694829-0525-42b1-a485-fb37a07f31ec.xhtml) from Imran Ahmad's *40 Algorithms Every Programmer Should Know*.
