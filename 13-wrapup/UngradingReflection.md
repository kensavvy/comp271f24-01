# Final Ungrading Reflection

Based on your code reviews — especially the frequency and severity of red-level issues, — your class attendance, engagement, and participation, propose your final course grade.

You may propose one of these grades:

* **A**: If your red-level issues were not repeated mistakes, there were few or no red-level issues after the midterm, your attendance was solid (missing no more than five meetings), your engagement was consistent, and your participation was noticeable. Additionally, you did not miss any assignments. You have spent significant time reviewing the curated O'Reilly collection and browsing the Oracle Java documentation—evidenced by the quality of your code. 

* **B**: If you had red-level issues for repeated mistakes but only for a couple of assignments, and although some red issues persisted after the midterm, they were not for the same errors. Your attendance was good (missing 6-10 meetings). In your midterm reflection, you noted areas for improvement in participation and engagement, and you can demonstrate progress in these areas. You missed no more than two assignments. You have spent some time reviewing the curated O'Reilly collection and Oracle Java documentation, but your code does not fully reflect these efforts.

* **C**: If your code consistently violated the Programmers' Pact after the midterm, with recurring issues, or your attendance was spotty (missing 11-20 meetings). If your midterm reflection highlighted needed improvements in attendance, participation, and engagement, but these were not achieved. You missed no more than two assignments. You have spent little or no time engaging with the curated O'Reilly collection or Oracle Java documentation.

* **D**: If you missed three or more assignments, missed more than 20 meetings, or faced significant challenges that prevented meaningful engagement with the course.

## Specifications for Your Final Reflection

Reflect on the quality of your work and participation throughout the course. Your reflection should be 200-300 words, submitted as a plain text file (no Word or PDF), and uploaded to Sakai. Please name the file `reflection.txt`.

### Key Points to Address
1. **Class Participation:** Attendance directly affects participation. Missing five or more meetings impacts this area. Reflect on your activity in class, such as asking or answering questions, and overall engagement.
   
2. **Code Quality:** The most significant measure of performance. Avoiding repeated mistakes and producing code that compiles are key positives. Repeated violations of the Programmers' Pact are concerning. Use documented code reviews to support your claims about improvement.

3. **Midterm Reflection:** Compare your work and progress since the midterm. Highlight specific changes or improvements.

### Required Opening Sentence
Your reflection **must begin with one of the following sentences**:

*I propose a `X` for my course grade.*

Replace `X` with A, B, C, or D. Note: No +/- grades please. **If your reflection does not start with this sentence, your final grade will default to your midterm grade or a C-, whichever is lower.**
