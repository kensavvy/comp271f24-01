# Assignment 09

## Part I: code review of previous assignment

Using the [solution](../08-sorting/DemoSorting.java) and [technical note](../08-sorting/TechNote.md) for the previous assignment, conduct a code review for your implementation of your performance testig method(s). In your review:

* describe any red, yellow, or green level issues with your code. For red and yellow issues, discuss what led to them;
* suggest how the code could be improved;
* reflect if the quality of your code is related to time management and how to mitigate things.
* propose how Leo's code can be improved.

Your review must exude professionalism: few (ideally no) typos, and nicely organized. You may produce it as a PDF file to attach to Sakai, or as plain text typed straight in the Sakai textbox. It may be a good idea if you used an editor to compose your review, then past the text in Sakai to avoid loss of data.
 

## Part II: Building a binary search tree with the help of AI

In class last week, we used chatGPT to write a [method that adds a note to a binary search tree](https://chatgpt.com/share/67261841-62fc-8000-bc24-7b5b99c8f36a). We had to re-prompt before we got code that is compliant with our style restrictions (aka the [Programmer's Pact](../misc/ProgrammerPact.pdf)).

Review the code from chatGPT (by the first link above) and try to implement it class `BST.java` here. Your code should have sufficient comments explaining what's the role of variable `parent`. Those comments should reflect your understanding of what `parent` does.

## Reading material
 
* The most complete treatment of sorting algorithms is [Chapter 5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/art-of-computer/9780321635792/ch05.xhtml) from Donald Knuth's *Art of Computer Programming: Volume 3: Sorting and Searching.* Section 5.2.4 deals with merge sort. Knuth's work takes some getting used to. Pseudocode is written in *assembly* for a fictitious computer called [MIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIX_(abstract_machine)).
